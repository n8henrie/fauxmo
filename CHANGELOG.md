  services easier in the future

## v0.3.2 :: 20160419

- `sock` kwarg to `create_datagram_endpoint` no longer necessary, restoring
  functionality to Python 3.4.0 - 3.4.3 (closes #6)
- `make_udp_sock()` no longer necessary, removed from `fauxmo.utils`
- Tox and Travis configs switched to use Python 3.4.2 instead of 3.4.4 (since
