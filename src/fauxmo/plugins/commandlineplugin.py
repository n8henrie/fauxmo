"""Fauxmo plugin that runs a command on the local machine.

Runs a `shlex`ed command using `subprocess.run`, keeping the default of
`shell=False`. Caveat emptor: there may be major security risks to running this
plugin, as it enables Fauxmo to run semi-arbitrary code, depending on your
configuration. By enabling or using it, you acknowledge that it could run
commands from your config.json that could lead to data compromise, corruption,
loss, etc. Consider making your config.json read-only. If there are parts of
this you don't understand, you should probably not use this plugin.

If the command runs with a return code of 0, Alexa should respond prompty
"Okay" or something that indicates it seems to have worked. If the command has
a return code of anything other than 0, Alexa stalls for several seconds and
subsequently reports that there was a problem (which should notify the user
that something didn't go as planned).

Note that `subprocess.run` as implemented in this plugin doesn't handle complex
commands with pipes, redirection, or multiple statements joined by `&&`, `||`,
`;`, etc., so you can't just use e.g. `"command that sometimes fails || true"`
to avoid the delay and Alexa's response. If you really want to handle more
complex commands, consider using this plugin as a template for another one
using `os.system` instead of `subprocess.run`, but realize that this comes with
substantial security risks that exceed my ability to explain.

Example config:
```
